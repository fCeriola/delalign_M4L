# delalign_M4L
This Max4Live device is meant for delaying the incoming audio by a number of samples realted to a distance. 

The main porpouse is to align different recordings of the same source. Tipically, a mutli-microphone record comprehends microphones at different distance between each other. \
As example, let's take a drum recording session: a snare stroke will arrive firstly on the snare microphone and after a while on the over head microphones, considering travelling speed of sound.
